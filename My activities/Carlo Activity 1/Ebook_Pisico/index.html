						Anna and the dashing officer,Count Vronsky.Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her
						<br>
						passionless marriage and must endure the hypocrisies of society.Set against a vast
						<br>
						and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major
						<br>
						characters create a dynamic imbalance,playing out the contrasts of city and country
						<br>
						life and all the variations on love and family happiness.

					<td><p>For daring to peer into the heart of an adulteress and enumerate its contents with
						<br>
						profound dispassion, the author of Madame Bovary was tried for"offenses against
						<br>
						morality and religion."What shocks us today about Flaubert's devatingsly realized
						<br>
						tale of a young woman destroyed by the reckless pursuit of her romantic dreams is
						<br>
						its pure artistry: the poise of its narrative structure,the opulence of its prose
						<br>
						(marvelously captured in the English translation of Francis Steegmuller), and its
						<br>
						creation of a world whose minor figures are as vital as its doomed heroine.
